# EEG Motor Imagery Data Preparation  
_Preparing BCI Competition IV Data (2a & 2b) for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Classification_

## 📖 Overview
This repository provides scripts and guidelines for preprocessing EEG motor imagery (MI) data from **BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b**. The prepared data is structured into **trials** suitable for training and evaluating machine learning and deep learning encoders for motor imagery classification tasks.

Datasets:
- **Dataset 2a**: 9 subjects, 22 EEG channels + 3 EOG channels, 4 MI classes (left hand, right hand, both feet, tongue).
- **Dataset 2b**: 9 subjects, 3 EEG channels, 2 MI classes (left hand, right hand).
